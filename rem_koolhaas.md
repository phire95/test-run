## Notes


### Texts

For my own bad memory's sake, I'm making small summaries and reminders of
Koolhaas' texts.


#### Bigness

First things first, let's clear up the following two words:

> _fuck_ context
>
> <cite>Rem Koolhaas</cite>, Bigness, in: [S, M, L, XL](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1885254865/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=1885254865&linkCode=as2&tag=zmlka-21&linkId=OJRQYJHV2U3T3EGY) 

Oft cited as if it were Koolhaas' architectural philosophy, it is actually
presented as the fifth and final property of ‘Bigness‘, the situation analysed
in the text. The full quote is:

> 5, Together, all these breaks - with scale, with architectural composition,
> with tradition, with transparency, with ethics - imply the final, most
> radical break: Bigness is no longer part of any urban tissue.  
> It exists; at most, it coexists.  
> Its subtext is _fuck_ context.
>
> <cite>Rem Koolhaas</cite>, Bigness, in: [S, M, L, XL](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1885254865/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=1885254865&linkCode=as2&tag=zmlka-21&linkId=OJRQYJHV2U3T3EGY) 

Now, then, Bigness. The problem of Large.

Past a certain scale, buildings become big buildings. Big buildings have unique
characteristics enabled by certain conditions (no longer controllable by one
architectural gesture, buildings with Bigness have autonomous parts; the
elevator, which nullifies scale; the façade can no longer reflect the interior,
as the distance between the exterior and interior is too large; the scale makes
buildings amoral, as they are beyond judgement; fuck context).

Bigness is a way out of the inevitable death of architecture ignited by May
'68 that resulted in two possible modes of architecture: dismantlement
(breaking the system by creating arbitrary systems[^attack1]) and disappearance
(virtuality [attack2]). How?

> Only through Bigness can architecture dissociate itself form the exhausted
> artistic/ideological movements of modernism and formalism to regain its
> instrumentality as a vehicle for modernization

…

> Through contamination rather than purity and quantity rather than quality,
> only Bigness can support genuinely new relationships between functional
> entities that expand rather than limit their identities. The artificiality
> and complexity of Bigness release function from its defensive armor to allow
> a kind of liquefaction; programmatic elements react with each other to create
> new events – bigness returns to a model of programmatic _alchemy_.

…

> Bigness no longer needs the city: it competes with the city; it represents
> the city; preempts the city; or better still, it _is_ the city. If urbanism
> generates potential and architecture exploits it, Bigness enlists the
> generosity of urbanism against the meanness of architecture.
>
> Bigness = urbanism vs  architecture.

The point of all of this, as understood by me, is pretty simple. Big things are
different from small things. This simple statement is so simple that it
approaches the sort of tautological word play you intuitively don't take
seriously or think about further, which indeed architects haven't. That's not
to say that designing something big is different from designing something
small, it is to say that a big object is different from a small one. A big
building, a Bigness level building, necessarily has characteristics that
differentiate it from buildings of smaller stature.

The rest is an expansion of that thought.

Noteworthy is that ‘Bigness’ is the introductory text to the ‘L’ section of
SMLXL.

## Quotes


> For me it (writing) is very brutal and primitive, because for me architecture
> is an intellectual discipline and for me writing is the privileged
> communication of our intellectual disciplines. So writing is absolutely
> without question necessary. We abuse the alibi of the otherness of our
> profession… you cannot write if you don't have ideas. I think there is still
> a very strong section in architecture that somehow hopes that there can be
> architecture without ideas.

Talking about his first encounter with a constructivist urban plan:

> As a scriptwriter I had a revelation that maybe I should not become a
> film maker but that architecture was perhaps a much more interesting domain
> because it enabled you to write scripts without the apparent triviality of
> film making, which is fiction, but with a potential of also realising those
> scripts in the real world.

### Quotes by others

> It's Rem because he doesn't believe in grammar. That's Rem, and that's good.
> Look, when he was at the Architecture Association School in 1972, in the
> spring of '72 when he quit – because he never finish school, you have to
> understand – because he went to the new director and he said, quote: "I want
> to learn fundamentals. Where can I learn fundamentals?"
>
> And the director looked at him and said: "We don't teach fundamentals here.
> We teach language." And then he quit. So there is a relationship between
> quitting the school in 1972 and Fundamentals today.

> For Rem, the project comes down to the idea of how can formal and
> organizational constraints (the grid, for example) paradoxically create
> programmatic liberties? How can architecture change behaviour? He's always
> pursued the same project – that's what _Delerious New York_ was about.

[^attack1]: Which Koolhaas discredits as follows: “The programmatic hybridizations / proximities / frictions /
overlaps / superposition's that are possible in Bigness  – in fact, the entire
apparatus of _montage_ invented at the beginning of the century to organize
relationships between independent parts – are being undone by one section of
the present avant-garde in compositions of almost laughable pedantry and
rigidity, behind apparent wildness.

[^attack2]: Which Koolhaas discredits as follows: “Pre-empting architecture's
actual disappearance, _this_ avant-garde is experimenting with real or
simulated virtuality, reclaiming, in the name of modesty, its former
omnipotence in the world of virtual realit (where fascism may be pursued with
impunity?)”
