## Quotes


> For me it (writing) is very brutal and primitive, because for me architecture
> is an intellectual discipline and for me writing is the privileged
> communication of our intellectual disciplines. So writing is absolutely
> without question necessary. We abuse the alibi of the otherness of our
> profession… you cannot write if you don't have ideas. I think there is still
> a very strong section in architecture that somehow hopes that there can be
> architecture without ideas.

### Quotes by others

> It's Rem because he doesn't believe in grammar. That's Rem, and that's good.
> Look, when he was at the Architecture Association School in 1972, in the
> spring of '72 when he quit – because he never finish school, you have to
> understand – because he went to the new director and he said, quote: "I want
> to learn fundamentals. Where can I learn fundamentals?"
>
> And the director looked at him and said: "We don't teach fundamentals here.
> We teach language." And then he quit. So there is a relationship between
> quitting the school in 1972 and Fundamentals today.
