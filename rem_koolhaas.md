## Quotes


> For me it (writing) is very brutal and primitive, because for me architecture
> is an intellectual discipline and for me writing is the privileged
> communication of our intellectual disciplines. So writing is absolutely
> without question necessary. We abuse the alibi of the otherness of our
> profession… you cannot write if you don't have ideas. I think there is still
> a very strong section in architecture that somehow hopes that there can be
> architecture without ideas.

### Quotes by others

> The first, perhaps most general, principle to note is that in OMA's proposals
> the *argument* always takes precedent over the *project*. In other words,
> there is always primarily an *engine*, be it discursive or diagrammatic,
> never a *design* that is introduced into the urban milieu to be reconfigured.
> It is never a question of organising a space at the outset, but rather of
> unleashing, trigging, or capturing larger and already existing processes.
>
