## Quotes

> The first, perhaps most general, principle to note is that in OMA's proposals
> the *argument* always takes precedent over the *project*. In other words,
> there is always primarily an *engine*, be it discursive or diagrammatic,
> never a *design* that is introduced into the urban milieu to be reconfigured.
> It is never a question of organising a space at the outset, but rather of
> unleashing, trigging, or capturing larger and already existing processes.
>
> <cite>Stanford Kwinter</cite>, Introduction to _Urbanism After Innocence:
> Four Projects_ in Assemblage 18
