So I am sifting, results below. Ordered in terms of least likeliness
to be removed from the list after more sifting. It's what I use for print, web
is slightly different because none of those sans-serifs are common across
platforms.

3. **Berthold Baskerville** – Extremely clean, lovely italics. Legible.
3. **FF DIN** - Instant classic. Started off using it mainly for architecture
   related things, now used practically everywhere.
3. **FF Meta** – Humanist. The Anti-Helvetica, and really damn useful.
1. **Linotype Gianotten** – This used to be Bodoni, but now I have switched
   over to primarily using a [Bodoni derivative](http://www.linotype.com/1046/linotypegianotten-family.html).
2. **Adobe Garamond** – Looks very good on bad paper.
5. **Linoype Univers** – Not really a universal font as the name would suggest,
   but a font that is elegantly geometric.
2. **Permian** - [link](http://permian.design.ru/). Designed for the city of
   Perm by Ilya Ruderman.

Note that the above does not apply to internet typography, where it's more of a
question of what font is most likely installed on all systems. Hence why this
is rendered in Verdana.
