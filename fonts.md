So I am sifting, results below. Ordered in terms of least likeliness
to be removed from the list after more sifting. It's what I use for print, web
is slightly different because none of those sans-serifs are common across
platforms.

1. **Bodoni** – 
2. **Garamond** – 
3. **Baskerville** – 
3. **Akzidentz-Grotesk** – Modern, with just the right amount of frivolous
   touches of ornament to be warm.
2. **DIN Pro** – For architecture and legibility.
3. **Meta** – Humanist. The Anti-Helvetica (which is not included because it is
   somewhere between AG and Univers)
5. **Univers** – Not really a universal font as the name would suggest, but a
   font that is elegantly geometric.
5. **The Sans Mono** – A highly legible, very complete monospaced font. Does
   not contain features necessary for computer terminal use (dotted or slashed
   zero etc.) but is extremely readable in long-form.
2. **Filozofia** – 
3. **Futura** – For headings. But honestly I haven't used it in ages.

Note that the above does not apply to internet typography, where it's more of a
question of what font is most likely installed on all systems. Hence why this
is written in Verdana.
