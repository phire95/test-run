## Quotes

> I believe the philosophy of deconstruction is a moral obligation. I believe
> I'm a moral architect because through my architecture I open up man's psyche
> to the unconscious and repressed side.

Asked if his Holocaus Memorial in Berlin is out to goad the audience:

> Not goad, but unsettle. Perhaps the way a picture by Caspar David Friedrich
> can be unsettling. It's beautiful, but at the same time there's something odd
> about its beauty. You can lose yourself in it, and get a feeling of being
> alone. The Memorial will have the same effect. If you wander through the
> steale, you lose your sense of direction and purpose and perhaps your
> certainties as well. The thing is, all that we have in our heads about the
> Holocaust is a jumble of photos and films. The Memorial attempts to break the
> power of these media images. It tries to overcome the hegemony of the visual
> side by going for primary physical experience and emotions.

### Quotes by others

In a book of 18 interviews with architects, three of them brought up Eisenman:

> I don't think that architecture can be critical or subversive. There are
> architects that see otherwise, Peter Eisenman, for example. He calls it
> subversive when his walls are slightly slanting. Subversion is simply a new
> form of style, nothing more.
>

> Architecture can't be critical at all, it can't oppose the reality it's
> designed for. Even Peter Eisenman doesn't believe in that sort of thing any
> more.

> (talking about his design for the Topography of Terror): You can't counter
> terrible things with horror. We don't need sombre event-architecture in order
> to remember, to understand, or be amazed. In the formidable monument that is
> Eisenman's stelae memorial, I see the beginning of another catastrophe lurking
> within. The memorial seems to me immensely rigid. It tries to discipline
> people. Even in the memory, a military stance is adopted.
