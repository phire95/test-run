A double lecture organised by [KRUH](http://www.kruh.info/) as part of their ETH themed lecture series. Each presenter spoke for about an hour, with, unusually, no questions at the end. Truth be told, anybody who had a question probably sensed that the majority of the room was too tired to participate.

Notes below. `My insertions/thoughts are formatted like this`.

**Ákos Moravánskzy - Constructing Clouds: Atmospheres in Swiss Architecture**

**Günther Vogt - The Nature of Cities**

1. Günther starts off by talking about how nice it is to teach landscape to architecture students, mainly because when they first show up they know nothing at all about environment. Many students come from the Zurich suburbs with very provincial views of architectue and the environment.
1. Key diffrenciator that he has to teach architects: architecture is much more universal (global) in the sense that when you see, for example, an office building, it could feasably be built anywhere in the world. However, landscape is much more context dependent. Oak trees don't grow in Hong Kong (Günther uses this as an example after he saw oak tres in a compentiton entry for Hong Kong).
1. Landscape in Switzerland: The Swiss Alps are a British idea. Historically the Alps were seen as something slightly dangerous, Switzerland needed to wait for the British to discover the Alps to romanticise them.
1. The Swiss National Park was created by people living in Basel. The creation of a National Park is a fundementally urban idea.
1. When Günther was a student in the 80's the motto and fear was that by 2014 Europe would have 50% less forests. The reality is the opposite: 50% more forests. The un-urban is being abandoned. (Günther showed a very nice map sowing future hotspots of abandoned landscapes in Europe, sadly I can't find it online).
1. Often we hear worries about sprawl. Sprawl is not the biggest problem, as it can be regulated. A much bigger problem is the space between sprawl, the infrastructure, the dead zones, etc, which can't be controlled. Especially in Switzerland where the communal decision making is quite strong.
1. In Switzerland, everything is built on top of a parking, Günther is glad for this as it means that what is above will not be destroyed, as happened to a few of his parks that did not have anything below them.
1. Final statement: "Recently, wherever I go I am shocked by the scale". Regardless of where it is, Rio, London, Istanbul, etc, the scale of what is being done nowdays seems way beyond the human scale.
