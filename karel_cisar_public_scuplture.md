snippet: Notes from Karel Císař's lecture about contemporary public sculpture
---

_30.05.2015, Academy of Arts, Architecture and Design in Prague_

This was quite a casual daytime presentation given for a specific audience, as
it took place in Dominik Lang's sculpture studio and hence seemed to be
tailored towards the students present. It was also rather exhaustive on the
information side, while also being fragmentary, a choice which makes sense
considering most of the audience composed (unlike me) lives the context.

The notes below are a very limited extract of the thoughts that Císař covered,
not least because, honestly, I'm not familiar with many of his examples so
spent more time enjoying looking than writing.

## Notes

1. Rosalin Krauss's famed article _Sculpture the expanded field_
    1. For Císař, the most interesting thought of the essay was that not always
       is everything possible.
    1. Not always are all forms possible.
    1. In Krauss's essay: “Because it was ideologically prohibited, the complex
       had remained excluded from what might be called the closure of post-
       Renaissance art. Our culture had not before been able to think the
       complex, although other cultures have thought this term with great
       ease.”
1. (This thought about some things just not being possible to do any more is at
   the heart of Císař's lecture. He argues that there are certain forms, styles
   or notions of sculpture that are dead, illogical and actually impossible to
   do in contemporary contexts. For example, nobody believes that it is
   possible to make a grand unified truthful statement, which nullifies
   monuments as a possibility, killed with the end of the modern project).
1. Public space is a relatively new topic of conversation
    1. Only with Hannah Ardent and Jürgen Habermas did public space become a
       topic in philosophy.
    1. Jürgen Habermas: public space is only created somewhere in the 16/17th
       centuries. Public space is not that what is outside, but a place where
       transactions/exchange happen.
1. We can generalise contemporary art is, to an extent, temporary. It does not
   think that it is capable of being eternal, instead it reacts to situations.
    1. Currently, the logic of monuments is unacceptable.
1. Císař briefly goes over the history of Kust fur Bau in Germany (something
   like the 1% for art rule in New York).
    1. States that in it resulted in huge quantities of works being produced,
       naturally the most during the Nazi reign, where it was used for
       propagandistic pieces, but also after the war.
    1. It came under heavy attack in the 60s and beyond, mainly the quality of
       the output. If you thin about it, it makes sense, one cant' expect every
       little village to assemble a good jury to call froth designs.
    1. Since, the trend has been more towards supporting pubic exhibitions
       instead of commissioning public artworks.
1. The current wave of sentimentality for normalisation-era[^normalisation] public
   works[^vetrelci] is naive, sine the critique of 50s era public works in
   Germany in the 60s is valid in this case too.
    1. We should realise that if the artists could, they would not have made
       the work which is being showered with sentiment. They made that work
       because they had no other means of livelihood or expression. The works
       are predominantly aesthetic decorations, and not much more.
1. Skulptur Projeke Münster
    1. Lots said about many of the years, many names and many interesting
       projects. Nos sense in repeating it here. With one exception.
    1. Michael Escher's Caravan, repeated in every incarnation of the project
       since the first one in 77.
        1. It is not the object that is important, but the system. The moving
           of the caravan is a part of the piece, and the system surrounding
           the work is from it.
        1. Císař believes that it is almost insurmountable in the way that it
           shows what public space is by negative means.
1. While putting together these slides Císař noticed one aspect that all the
   work seemed to share. It does not attempt to make new forms. All the public
   sculptures and interventions work with existing, recognisable, anatomies.
1. My notes end here, below are some post-faktum notes about the general gist
   of the main point that Císař was making.
    1. The big idea was that there are some things that were possible to do
       earlier, but are impossible to do now. Monuments exemplify what Císař
       sees as impossible, for no longer do we believe that eternal gestures 
       are valid.
    1. Contemporary public sculpture tends to not only respond to context, but
       also not make the assumption that it will be there forever. See, for
       example, the various biennales and temporary shows.
    1. This creates an interesting tension about how to deal with past
       monuments. What to do with busts of Lenin, socialist realism, etc.




[^normalisation]: In the Czech Republic, normalisation refers to the period between 1968 and 1989 during which the reforms introduced by the Prague Spring were undone and socialism was "noramalised". See [wikipedia]
[^vetrelci]: Císař is clearly referring to [Vetřelci a Volavky], a portal/book/community that maps and creates support for normalisation era public works that is currently quite popular.
