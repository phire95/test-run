## Writing

Below is my translation of a text that appeared in the Czech publication [Texty
o architektu≈ôe 01/02](http://kruh.info/)


Once you kinda wake up and there it is.  
A discomforting for the future you sighted at dawn between dreams...  
And then you forget; however your subconscious keeps at it. Some day, later, the
feeling comes back as fact, as reality.  
A rush of energy. No way back. Elements begin to connect. Suddenly it's lucid,
it's everywhere, the birds are singing it.  
The exclusive game is done. The future is you and your freedom of choice.  
The exclusive game of architecture as a rink for you architects where you play for
the space for others is no longer purposeful.  
It no longer engages me.  
My attention is turned to finding accessible mechanisms for opening up the game
to all its contributors, to all its consumers.  
In the process of devising space used by other subjects, an open source
programmer keeps a distance and only ensures the technical and intellectual
framework of a system.  
As consumers personally, separately, come  with their individualities they
become part of the concept and enrich, co-create, the organically growing
construct with their activities.  
I believe in the unbounded aesthetic and social potential of an open game.

The future starts today and signs point to us living through big things.
