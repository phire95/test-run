## Quotes

The aware room. The end of the first paragraph of _The Crying of Lot 49_. ‘The
room‘ here referring to the combination of a space and its boundaries, not other
occupants of the space (as would be the case when saying “the whole room looked
at me”), for Oedipa is the only person present.

> That only made her laugh, out loud and helpless: You're so sick, Oedipa, she
> told herself, or the room, which knew.
