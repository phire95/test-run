## Notes

### Dennis Hayes

1. In the philosophy of education, critical thinking is "the ability to engage
   in deep conversation"
1. There are, generally, three misconceptions about critical thinking:
    1. The misconception that critical thinking is a skill. Training is not
       critical thinking.
    1. The misconception that "critical something" is critical. It is an
       indoctrination, for example critical architecture is that which shows an
       ideology.
    1. The misconception that critical is cynical.
1. Best definition of criticism: a disinterested endevour to learnd and
   propagate the best that is known in the world.
1. Criticism has become mainstream with the loss of actual crises. Instead we
   manufacture our own "philosophies" through being theraputically self
   critical.
1. The whole idea of descussion and debate has become very safe and
   unconfrontational.

### Steve Parnell

1. No monument has ever been erected to a critic
1. Criticism is putting something into a state of crisis and seeing to which
   side of theknife edge things fall.
