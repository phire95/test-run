*14.07.2004 - ARUP Associates, London*

Part of the Critical Subjects summer school series of debates, lectures and panel discussions.

## Notes

### Dennis Hayes

* In the philosophy of education, critical thinking is "the ability to engage in deep conversation"
* There are, generally, three misconceptions about critical thinking:
  * The misconception that critical thinking is a skill. Training is not critical thinking.
  * The misconception that "critical something" is critical. It is an indoctrination, for example critical architecture is that which shows an ideology.
  * The misconception that critical is cynical.
* Best definition of criticism: a disinterested endevour to learnd and propagate the best that is known in the world.
* Criticism has become mainstream with the loss of actual crises. Instead we manufacture our own "philosophies" through being theraputically self critical.
* The whole idea of descussion and debate has become very safe and unconfrontational.

### Steve Parnell

* No monument has ever been erected to a critic
* Criticism is putting something into a state of crisis and seeing to which side of hte knife edge things fall.
