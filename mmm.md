## Quotes

> Our fashion was probably intellectual sometimes and we hope it was always
> intelligent. If some designers' will is to be labelled intellectual it's
> probably to give their work a more ‘respectable’ aspect, to bring it closer to
> art and as far as possible from its original purpose, that is to put clothes
> on people's bodies. Like a lot of things, when you try too hard, then it's
> definitely ‘out of it’ and you have missed what you were aiming at. A dress
> that tries too hard to be intellectual and/or intelligent will automatically
> become ridiculous.
