## Lines

When you google ‘Margiela lines’ you usually end up looking at [this image](http://thedillychic.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Margiela-0-23.jpg).
While a useful reminder, it is not very descriptive. Below is an extract of the
Glossary placed towards the end of [Maison Martin Margiela](http://amzn.to/1Uizl0m)
which gives more information. Keep in mind this was published in 2008.

### Line 0 – “Artisanal” collection for women and men

Garments, fabrics and accessories reworked by hand – hence the label
“Artisanal” – for both women and men. Since 1988, Maison Martin Margiela has
used found garments, accessories and other second-hand items– or at times new
ones – skillfully transforming these raw materials into entirely new creations.
Each piece is made or reworked entirely by hand in Maison Martin Margiela's
in-house atelier in Paris. The time needed to make each item varies from 5 to 6
days. Each item is completely unique and produced in very small quantities. The
label, numbered ‘0’, is sewn, embossed or stamped according to the material or
composition of the garment. This line is presented during the haute couture
collections in Paris twice a year.

### The “Show” collection for women

_completely white label_

The original and primary collection of women's ready-to-wear by Maison Margin
Margiela debuted for the SS 1989. This collection has traditionally of the
Maison's fashion shows and exhibitions. Whereas all the other Maison Martin
Margiela lines have label on which the numbers ‘0’ to ‘23’ are printed, this
collection still carries an entirely blank white, with the four white stitches
holding it in in place visible on the exterior of unlined garments. Originally,
the white label was used for Line 1, which has become an independent line since
2008.

### Line 1 – The collection for women

Maison Martin Margiela began it's collection for women for SS 1989. ‘1’ is the
collection in which Maison Martin Margiela expresses its love for concept,
design and process, for creativity and avant-garde. It is through this
collection that the house has insistently questioned accepted ideas about
fashion, presenting its restatements through acts of deconstruction and
transformation. As of AW 2008-09, this label will have the ‘1’ encircled.

### Line 4 – A wardrobe for women

‘4’ is Maison Martin Margiela's vision of a wardrobe for women. The fourth
label of women's clothes; it was first introduced for SS 2004 and compliments
line 1. The garments of ‘4’ evoke timelessness. Its foundation is that of a
personal approach to dress, fixed on a taste rather than on a seasonal approach
to design, or a particular age group. Extra care and craft have been attributed
to construction, fit, choice of fabrics, hand-finishing and to the perfection
of the interior and exterior detailing of all its garments.

### MM6 – Garments for ♀

Another complimentary vision of Maison Martin Margiela's take on femininity:
usually – thought not always – less conceptual, these garments draw their
inspiration from and lend themselves to the more casual moments of life, often
with a humoristic twist. MM6 combines garments, shoes and accessories.

### Line 8 – Eyewear collection

‘8’ was first introduced for the SS 2008 collection with its first model,
“incognito”: a lateral stribe crosses the face and nose, becoming one lens for
both eyes. This model will be followed by various iterations each season.

### Line 10 – The collection for men

‘10’ is the men's version of Line 1. It was first introduced in October 1998
for SS 1999.

### Line 14 – A wardrobe for men

‘14’ is the men's version of line 10. It was first introduced in July 2004 for
SS 2005.

### Line 11 – A collection of accessories for women and men

‘11’ encompasses the traditional categories of items for an accessories
collection: bags, belts, small leather goods and a few items of jewellery.

### Line 12 – A collection of fine jewellery

This collection is the result of the creative collaboration between Maison
Martin Margiela and the Damiani Group. IT combines traditional craftsmanship
and innovative technology, using precious metals and stones.

### Line 22 – A collection of shoes for women and men
Ever since the design of the first Maison Martin Margiela “Tabi-boot” for hte
SS 1989 collection, the Maison has had a small seasonal selection of women's
and men's shoes as part of Line 1 and 10. AW 2005-06 was the first time the
shoes, for men and women, were all grouped within one collection, with its own
structure and development plan. The Maison established a “laboratory” for the
craft of shoe making, and takes pride in having the shoes manufactured in the
smallest ateliers across Italy. With each design, Maison Martin Margiela
approaches an atelier – often specialists in bespoke items – that could best
realise that particular type of shoe.

### Line 13 – Objects and publications
‘13’ includes “white objects” (feather pen, bottle-lamp), household effects in
dominant white tones (carpets, wallpapers) books (_Street_, _2000-1_) and
special projects.

### Line 3 – Fragrances for women and men
Maison Martin Margiela had always invested in olfactory effects; patchouli
essence has been used incense in its stores and offices sice the inception of
the company.

### “Sartorial”
A capsule collection, part of Line 14, that can easily be identified by the
curved dart that is used on the front of coats and suits, or by the gold lining
embroided with “Maison Martin Margiela”. The “Sartorial” collection uses the
traditional savoire-faire and techniques of tailors in Naples and Savile Row.
THe internal structure of coats and jackets is made of horsehair stitched by
hand, prividing an impeccable fit and posture, and longer preservation.

### “Replica”

Each season, lines 4 and 14 contain a group of “Replica” items. Thes are
existing garments, accessories and other articles that Maison Martin Margiela
cherishes, and as such prefers that they remain exactly as they were found.
They are then lavishly reproduced and carry a second label explaining their
origin, function and period. The role of Maison Martin Margiela as designer sis
to ensure tha the choice of fabric and the construction of these articles
resemble the original as closely as possible.
