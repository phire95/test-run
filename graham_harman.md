## Quotes

> Even as the philosophy of language and its supposedly reactionary opponents
> both declare victory, the arena of the world is jam-packed with diverse
> objects, their forces unleashed and mostly unloved. Red billiard ball smacks
> green billiard ball. Snowflakes glitter in the light that cruelly annihilates
> them; damaged submarines rust along the ocean floor. As flour emerges from
> mills and blocks of limestone are compressed by earthquakes, gigantic
> mushrooms spread in the Michigan forest. While human philosophers bludgeon
> each other over the very possibility of "access" to the world, sharks
> bludgeon tuna fish, and icebergs smash into coastlines.
>
> All of these entities roam across the cosmos, inflicting blessings and
> punishments on everything they touch, perishing without a trace or spreading
> their powers further--as if a million animals had broken free from a zoo in
> some Tibetan cosmology. Will philosophy remain satisfied with not addressing
> any of these objects by name, so as to confine itself to a "more general"
> discussion of the condition of the condition of the condition of possibility
> of ever referring to them? Will philosophy continue to lump together monkeys,
> tornadoes, diamonds, and oil under the single heading of
> that-which-lies-outside? Or is there some possibility of an object-oriented
> philosophy, a sort of alchemy for describing the transformations of one
> entity into another, for outlining the ways in which they seduce or destroy
> humans and non-humans alike? This paper endorses the latter option.

> "A traditional Zen story speaks of a temple novice who hoped to attain
> enlightenment by chopping a cat in half with a sword. Witnessing the
> preparations for this atrocity, the head monk cried out and asked the
> newcomer to explain himself.
>
> “I am cutting the cat _in two_ with _one_ sword,” was the young man's reply.
>
> Outdoing this supposed paradox of duality and unity, the monk countered with
> the following remark: “It is easy to cut the cat in two with one sword. What is
> difficult is to cut the cat _in one_ with one sword.”
>
> “But what is ‘cutting the cat in one’?”
>
> “The cat itself”
>
> Hearing this reply from his master, the novice attained enlightenment.
