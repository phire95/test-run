## Quotes

> Architecture doesn't just happen, it is a coincidence of forces, a conspiracy
> of requirements, expectations, regulations and, hopefully, visions. It
> requires collaboration and its success is subject to the quality of that
> collaboration. This participation is not just between professionals but
> undertaken together with society, those who commission, regulate and most
> importantly occupy our buildings and cities.
>
> It is tempting to imagine that good architecture is the consequence of
> freedom, both intellectual and practical, but the understanding of limits,
> the coordination of constraints and negotiation with resistance are
> fundamental to a healthy architectural culture. It is only through dialogue
> and a willingness to understand the diverse concerns and responsibilities
> involved in the process of making architecture that these forces can be
> coordinated towards a significant result.
>
> If we accept this then we must also accept that good architecture is not just
> dependent on genius nor can it only be achieved only through confrontation
> and despite circumstances. Individual talent and creativity depend on and
> contribute to a rich and complex culture of shared affinities, references and
> predicaments that give validity and meaning, not only to architecture, but to
> its place in society.
>
> I have invited my colleagues to examine what we share over what distinguishes
> us from one another, and in so doing to demonstrate that the quality of
> architecture depends on common values, efforts and visions. We must not
> forget that as we plan our future we are always building on what has come
> before.
>
> Common Ground gives us the excuse to consider the efforts of architects not
> as solitary and fashionable gestures but as part of a rich and continuous
> investigation of intellectual, social and physical ideas, given purpose not
> only by their shared concerns but by the desire to make a meaningful
> contribution to our physical world.

> ‘Common Ground’ provokes us to admit the continuities and influences that I
> believe define our profession. The phrase also tries to train our attention
> on the city, which is our area of expertise and activity, but also something
> created in collaboration with every citizen, and the many stakeholders and
> participants in the process of building.
>
> The theme of the Biennale was a provocation to my colleagues to demonstrate
> their commitment to these shared and common values, encouraging them away
> from a monographic presentation of their work, towards a portrait of the
> collaborations and affinities behind their work. That they have all engaged
> in this with such commitment and energy is a testament to them and
> confirmation of what we know but don't articulate sufficiently: that despite
> our different concerns, backgrounds and points of view we do indeed share
> ‘common ground’.
