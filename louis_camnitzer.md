## Quotes

> Art has slowly deteriorated to become primarily a form of production instead
> of a way of shaping culture. Thus, it is viewed as a discipline and not as a
> methodology. I see art as the area where one can and should make “illicit”
> connections, connections that are not allowed in disciplinary, fragmented
> thinking. Art illuminates them through questioning and allows (though not
> necessarily) for their possible affirmation after a critical and imaginative
> evaluation. This should be art’s social function, but it has been degraded by
> commerce.
