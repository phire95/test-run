title: Monika Mitášová — Is Critical Architecture Possible?
---

*06.05.2014, Czech Technical University, Faculty of Architecture* 

Apparently this horribly advertised lecture was part of Monika Mitasova's
habilitation process, I only knew about it via word of mouth, which is a shame
as it was very good and quite unlike a typical architecture related
presentation. 

** Is Critical Architecture Possible?** 

Straight away it is clear that Monika will be explaining Peter Eisenman's views
of/on critical architecture, referring almost purely to his work on Guiseppe
Terragni's Casa del Fascio that he explored in his 1963 thesis (The Formal
Basis of Modern Architecture) and 2003 book on Terragni (Transformations,
Decompositions, Critiques). 

The lecture was dense with information and visuals, much of which has can be
found in Eisenman's work (it was, after all, a recapitulation of his research).
This mean I took hardly any notes. However, some things/thoughts that stood
out: 

1. Eisenman, after Greenberg, thinks that architecture is, to some degree,
   autonomous. Meaning it has it's own internal expression. 
1. Some thoughts that were thrown around to help understand what is meant by
   critical architecture: 
  1. critical architecture "demystifies" previous assumptions 
  1. critical architecture is that which creates precedents. Meaning: that
     which is alternate to the now. (think: the avant-garde is, by definition,
     the forefront of the masses) 
  1. critical architecture is that which allows for critical (ambiguous)
     interpretations (problematic). This is very much related to the point
     above. 
1. Practically everything in the Casa del Fascio was custom made, overseen by
   the architect. This allowed to house to be completely *new and *original*. 
  

At the post lecture question time is where it got more interesting, as it is
where we started to get the opinions of people in the room and not Peter
Eisenman. 

1. Jiří Ševčík mentions something along the lines of "the problem of this
   approach is it's unsocial" 
  1. It is unclear if he was referring to Eisenman's understanding of
     architecture, or Terragni's building. 
1. An overdressed (three piece suit, pocket square) man wanted clarification
   the role of post-factum interpretation

Personal reflections/thoughts 

I have hard time swallowing any claims of the autonomy of architecture. These
views come up quite frequently under different names: elementary forms,
architectural truth, 

note: Considering the relative obscurity of this book, I was surprised to find
it has an above-averate quantity of reviews on amazon.com, of which only 3 are
favourable.
