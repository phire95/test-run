snippet: Notes and Thoughts from Monika Mitášovás lecture on critical architecture

_06.05.2014, Czech Technical University, Faculty of Architecture_

Apparently this horribly advertised lecture was part of Monika Mitasova's
habilitation process, I only knew about it via word of mouth, which is a shame
as it was very good and quite unlike a typical architecture related
presentation. 

## Notes

Straight away it is clear that Monika will be explaining Peter Eisenman's views
of/on critical architecture, referring almost purely to his work on Guiseppe
Terragni's Casa del Fascio that he explored in his 1963 thesis (The Formal
Basis of Modern Architecture) and 2003 book on Terragni (Transformations,
Decompositions, Critiques[^amazon]).

The lecture was dense with information and visuals, much of which has can be
found in Eisenman's work (it was, after all, a recapitulation of his research).
This mean I took hardly any notes. However, some things/thoughts that stood
out: 

1. Eisenman, after Greenberg, thinks that architecture is, to some degree,
   autonomous. Meaning it has it's own internal expression. 
1. Some thoughts that were thrown around to help understand what is meant by
   critical architecture: 
    1. critical architecture "demystifies" previous assumptions 
    1. critical architecture is that which creates precedents. Meaning: that
       which is alternate to the now. (think: the avant-garde is, by
       definition, the forefront of the masses) 
    1. critical architecture is that which allows for critical (ambiguous)
       interpretations (problematic). This is very much related to the point
       above. 
1. Practically everything in the Casa del Fascio was custom made, overseen by
   the architect. This allowed to house to be completely *new and *original*. 
  

At the post lecture question time is where it got more interesting, as it is
where we started to get the opinions of people in the room and not Peter
Eisenman. 

1. Jiří Ševčík mentions something along the lines of "the problem of this
   approach is it's unsocial" 
    1. It is unclear if he was referring to Eisenman's understanding of
       architecture, or Terragni's building. Monika stated that Terragni's
       building did have a social agenda, but did not state anything on
       Eisenman's approach.
1. An overdressed (three piece suit, pocket square) young boy/man wanted
   clarification the role of post-factum interpretation in Eisenman's
   understanding of what constitutes as critical architecture. Does it mean
   that, for example, a building can be critical only after it is built and
   reinterpreted, or, to put it another way, were Palladio's villas critical
   only after somebody re-interpreted them? Monika replies that no, one does
   not need time and to be re-interpreted in order to be critical, one can
   already be critical with regards to past (in the current present). It seems
   that there was some confusion with Eisenman's notion of critical
   architecture and Eisenman's notion of canon.

## Thoughts

I have hard time swallowing any claims of the autonomy of architecture. These
views come up quite frequently under different names: elementary forms,
architectural truth, autopoiesis, allusions to architecture as a distinct
language, &c. Eisenman of course is very much in line with the latter of these
claims, with much of his early work relating to semiotics, and much of his
thinking/building revolving around Architecture, capital-A, self reflexive on
the discipline.

The issue is that even if one were to take the linguistic approach, that which
Eisenman uses as a basis point for architecture's autonomy one can easily see
and conclude that it actually points to the opposite. Language is dependant on
externalities, it is shaped by outside forces and there is nothing fundamental
about grammar[^kohn]. Knowing that, it becomes difficult to argue for the
fundamental necessity of certain architectural forms or concepts, it turns into
just another form of reductionism justified by conventions.

So much for comments on autonomy.

One has to applaud Eisenman's study of Terragni, it reveals the building to be
an interesting topic historically (the state of the Fascist party at the at
point), architecturally (it's inventiveness and genesis) and intellectually
(the potential readings of it). What particularly caught my attention was how,
for a building that appears extremely stable, it is full of intended
ambiguities; for example the trick of needing to open a window for it to gain a
full platonic shape, making the building be in a kind of exponential limbo
about it's solidity. It seems clear, but it isn't and can never be.

It raises interesting questions which I'll have to consider. How to make an
architecture that acknowledges the ambiguity of things? How to show the
instability of any object's self conception? Can we do it without slipping ito
metaphor? It's a very [OOO](ooo) thought, hence my interest in it.



[^amazon]: Considering the relative obscurity of this book, I was surprised to find it has an above-average quantity of reviews on [amazon](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1885254962/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=1885254962&linkCode=as2&tag=zmlka-21), of which only 3 are favourable. 

[^kohn]: See, for exmaple, Kohn's recent (and excellent) [How Forests Think](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0520276116/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0520276116&linkCode=as2&tag=zmlka-21), one of who's many topics is the influence of the surrounding world on language.
