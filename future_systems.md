### Library

Just a few years ago the book was declared dead with such confidence and
finality that no argument seemed possible. It's a prediction that, as we should
have known, was as flawed and shallow as the alleged end of history that
accompanied the closing stages of the cold war. There are so many things about
the idea of a library that are so fundamental that they don't need to be
reinvented. And a national library is equally fundamental building block in the
cultural infrastructure of any state. Cities decentralise, Google is working on
putting every book every written online, to the outrage of the copyright
holders, but still we need places in which you can smell ink on paper, explore
bindings, and the marginal notes, and share a space with others to whom books,
words and ideas matter. If the idea of the library is an unchanging
fundamental, the architectural language that it speaks, and the technical
principles that allow it to function, continually evolve. They are the marks
succeeding generations leave of themselves to their successors.

The realm of the book is one that is both private and public. A national
library that carries with it all the highly charged associations of a crucial
cultural institution, must at the same time support the scholars and the
scholarship which it exists to serve. It must celebrate their work, and mark
the significance that they have for a society. It must be protective of fragile
literary treasures and provide an appropriate atmosphere for study. But neither
is it a monastery.

Scholars and their work today belong to the wider world, and a national library
must embrace it and welcome it. A library has to address both the technical,
functional issues, and the emotional ones. It must be a place in which the raw
materials of the scholar's work are accessible with the minimum of fuss and
friction. But it must also mirror its institutional significance. It must look
to the outside world, both symbolically and literally. There are times when the
scholar must look beyond the page to refresh themselves and to rest their eyes,
and to be reminded of the material world around them. And the library must
provide a sense of reward for those visitors who are not specialist scholars
but come to see a national treasure.  Nor can it take their interest for
granted. It must work to earn its place at the centre of national life by
encouraging visitors and offering them an engaging experience. The library is
both a landmark for Prague: one that grows from the landscape, and the city's
architectural tradition, and a vantage point, perhaps the best in the city. As
such it is the physical embodiment of all that a national library must be, in
both the practical, and the symbolic sense. It is a reflection of its own time,
as well as of the fundamental notion of a timeless institution that is a
library.

### Site & Architecture

#### Site

The new national library is at the edge of the enormous existing park
of Letna. New park area and row of public buildings will be placed as part of
new urban plan. Future tunnel entrance with great amount of pollution and noise
is certainly not best site for building of national importance. New and
progressive urban plan for whole Letna site is absolutely necessary.
Greenery should dominate. Trees and more trees. Library as eco building in the
park. Letna as a place of peace, democracy and culture. Not a place for military
parades. Easy pedestrian access from tram, metro, park and street from all
directions.

#### Architecture

Architecture of proposed building is three dimensional volume hardly touching
the ground. Simple, modern, exciting, progressive, colourful and unique.
Minimal volume protruding above trees level. Champagne colour creating link
with past and future. It is architecture for the third millennium. It is
architecture for people, kids, disabled, and scholars. External and internal
architecture in balance. Private spaces, public spaces. Architecture which
invites people in. Architecture with views. Happy architecture. Architecture
for the book. People and books dominate building. Easy movement of the people.
Lifts and ramps. Architecture of new national library in Prague.

#### Podium - level 0
Podium itself is finished in unpolished white marble. With perimeter edges
lifted up in certain areas. Sloping surfaces covered with mirrored, finished
stainless steel. Building is reflected in these 'mirrors' from different
angles. Whole building is visually elevated over the podium. Groups of pine
trees. Ivy on car park banks. Creating green visual barrier. Boulders around
trees. Seating everywhere. Stainless steel bowls as springs inserted in the
marble surface. Water overflow going into little streams. Perhaps coloured
water. In winter heated water. Creating here all year garden. Colour ramps and
staircases. Miniature café. People sitting, walking, relaxing. Most modern,
artistic podium. Podium of new national library. In the middle spaces essential
for running of the library. Supplies in rubbish out. Books in and out. Several
loading bays. Separate loading bays for books. Rooms for library staff. Day
lit, naturally ventilated car park. Easy parking for deliveries and cars.

Book is the main and most important element of the design. Architecture for the
book. An essential part of our culture. Always was, and always will be. From
stone pieces, ceramic tiles, hand written, art pieces, first prints, modern
paperback to latest cd. Book will stay with us.

Storage of book is an essential part of the library. It makes the library.
Right storage system is vital. Extendibility crucial. The proposed system has
it all. Fully automatic. The storage and retrieval system is designed to
guarantee the return of any book to its original tote location within the
storage. Fully tested and already in use in other libraries. No human hand
touches the book. Safe.

Any book or document will reach the reader or staff member within 5 minutes. It
is multifunctional and ergonomically designed. Storage and retrieval book
centres for internal or reader usage.

#### Structure

The superstructure is designed as a structural steel frame with internal
columns on a 12m x 9m grid, supporting a composite floor made up of steel beams
and concrete floor slabs. Due to the reduction of floor area at each level,
perimeter columns will be inclined to support slab edges allowing for a 3m
perimeter cantilever zone. Lateral stability of the frame will be provided by
internal concrete cores working in combination with the façade of the building.
The façade itself will consist of tension cables supporting insulated aluminium
cladding panels. The skin will be connected to the internal framework by a ring
beam located at level 7. The ring beam is a key structural element which not
only supports the 'hung' façade with but also supports a series of steel
arches at the top of the structure.

The substructure consists of a 15m deep, single-storey basement used as the
principle book storage and archive area. The perimeter retaining walls are
conceived as 1.2m thick diaphragm walls, stiffened by buttresses and
intermediate whaling beams which are designed to resist the large earth
pressures resulting from the depth of basement. On the inside face of the
diaphragm wall, a 300mm reinforced concrete lining wall will be cast to form a
second barrier against water ingress. A 1.2m thick raft slab will form the
bottom of the basement box, bearing onto the shale strata, and will act as the
foundation for all internal columns. The slab itself will be cast immediately
onto a drainage blanket restricting the amount of water which will permeate
into the slab. In addition, a drained wall and floor cavity will be provided to
complete the waterproofing system. The internal lining to the wall cavity will
be constructed of two skins of block work with a water/vapour resisting membrane
in between. The cavity beneath the floor will be formed from
purpose-made tiles overlain by a water/vapour resisting membrane. This system
enables any water which has entered the structure to be contained and directed
to sumps, from where it is removed by pumping.

#### Environment
Light. Generous levels of natural light in all public areas are provided by
circular areas of glazing distributed over the external skin, creating a human
friendly condition with strong visual connections to the outside world, whilst
providing a calm atmosphere for contemplation and creativity. Natural light
levels in many public areas will be sufficient for circulation and reading for
more than 70% of library opening hours - substantial savings in electric
lighting energy will therefore be achieved. However, the extent of glazing in
the building envelope is carefully controlled and relatively modest - it has
been calculated that a skin with 15% glazing gives the optimum carbon efficiency
balance when heating, cooling and electric lighting usage are considered for a
whole year.

Climate and environmental control. The climatic control system for the building
follows the same objective of a calm and comfortable environment with low
energy consumption. A low velocity mechanical ventilation system is used to
bring a controlled amount of fresh air into the occupied areas of the building
- the air is supplied into the library, auditorium, offices and study rooms
through a raised floor. This low level supply arrangement is silent and energy
efficient, and avoids the risks of excessive noise and dusty intrusion that
would enter through opening windows. Some degree of local climate control will
be provided for library staff using small localised fan units within the floor
cavity. The retaining walls in the basement will be configured as a thermal
labyrinth to give passive climatic conditioning to the whole building incoming
fresh air will be tempered by indirect contact with the mass of the earth by
passing through the cavity wall around the basement perimeter, giving free
cooling in summer and free heating in winter. The basement location for book
storage means that the store is not exposed to natural light or the extremes of
the external climate. The automatic book retrieval system can largely work in
darkness, without the need for extensive electric lighting. A very low capacity
heating and cooling system is therefore all that is required to keep optimal
climatic conditions within the store.
