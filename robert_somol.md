### Quotes by others

> **Q:** …Robert Somol's and Michael Speaks' relation to ANY is not so clear
> anymore…
>
> **A:** That really had to do with Bob's argument that poststructuralist
> theory had turned into a justification for indexical procedures, and
> indexical procedures had become only interesting because they were indexical
> procedures. They had lost their force to produce a significant critical
> effect; you know, it's like gestural painting
>
> And Bob Somol said, look, there are certain problems that we haven't been
> able to solve, like urbanism. And the New Urbanists have been able to
> solve them because they were able to project a lifestyle. Instead of
> critiquing institutions or clichés, the critique had so succeeded that it had
> become the worse cliché. So Bob introduced the idea of _the projective_ – he
> basically was an anti-Tafurian, obviously, and tried to pick up Banham's
> idea. It was a really smart thing to do. It required a new kind of rigour. It
> also meant the discourse had to be internal. In other words, you couldn't
> justify it because Foucault said this or that. You basically said here are
> some effects we can produce; here are some effects we need to produce. And
> then you had to do that.
