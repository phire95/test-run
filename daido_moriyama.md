## Quotes

> Art is, in a way, creating something out of nothing. But photography, in its
> very essence, does not create something from nothing, it is a device for
> copying existing images.
>
> Then why not start from this assumption of copying, so we can get closer to
> the essence of a photograph. It has no meaning to create art work by one's
> own aesthetic and concepts, however, when people take photos, one's aesthetic
> and memory are always included. This is a kind of everlasting contradiction.
> This contradiction is acceptable.
>
> The world is not only one world, but the world itself is scattered, we just
> copy these scattered worlds by using photography.
>

> Realism itself is not exciting, and also conceptual and aesthetic art is not
> exciting. What I have to do by using photography is to think about the other
> important image in between, the world of the copy. Photography has no
> originality.

> Photos are not only the images which you consciously take. If there are any
> photos which have completely off images, once I recognise them as photos,
> they are photos.
