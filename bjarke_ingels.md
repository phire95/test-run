## Quotes

> The funny thing is that all the things that end up becoming the values that
> somehow define you, are all the things you take for granted. I grew up in a
> tiny house with a giant garden, it's not my self image to be an
> environmentalist and it's not my self image to be a social activist. But you
> can't see the forest for the trees.
