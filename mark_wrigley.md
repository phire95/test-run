> **A:**It is to large degree an attempt to react to the canonical histories of
> Banham, Pevsner, Giedion, etc. and doubt them, but above all I wanted to show
> how problematic the most obvious aspects of modern architecture are – only
> looking at the evident ones, no subtleties. There are a million other books
> that revise the history of modern architecture, all of which I like and are
> much more sophisticated than mine and deal with complicated issues, such as
> post-colonial identity, economic power, etc.

> But I'm simply just fascinated by a box with white walls and a flat roof, and
> the way that this thing was never even close to being was written about it.
> Modern architecture was never what was said it was, not even on the most
> fundamental level. I wanted to call into doubt these points of view – not for
> historical reasons, but theoretical ones. At the end of the day, I'm most
> fascinated by ornament.  Basically it's a book about ornament, the same way
> that the book about deconstruction was about ornament too.

> Ornament is, by definition, something that does not have to be. To me there
> is nothing more pleasing than to show that the very thing that does not have
> to be is exactly that without which there would be nothing. Modern
> architecture is a great example to look at because it seemingly removed
> everything that was not necessary to further the necessary. Ornament was one
> of the easy targets, it was very simple to say: no, no, no!

> I'm of the opinion that not a single architect from the modern movement
> didn't believe that they were removing decoration. Le Corbusier was, most
> likely, the smartest, and his slogan that the decorative arts of today is art
> which is not decorative, shows perfect understanding of the paradox that a
> white wall is the decorative art of today; that removing decoration is the
> decorative stance of today's time. He knew very well that he was not removing
> ornament – he newly defined what it should be. Just like Adolf Loos, who
> allowed decoration suitable for the it's time. The book, therefore, attempted
> to get people to think more about ornament than modern architecture.
