## Quotes

> I would be first understood as a theorist; then, secondly, as a historian of
> theory; then, only thirdly, as a historian, maybe. What does that mean? That,
> as a theorist, I'm more interested in the things that stay the same than the
> things that change – as a historian, you're very much interested in the
> change.

> **A:** It very much is an attempt to challenge or to question the canonic
> histories of Banham, Pevsner, Giedion, and so on, but mainly to show how the
> most obvious aspects of modern architecture were problematic – just the most
> obvious, nothing subtle. There are millions of other books, revisionist
> histories of modern architecture being written, all of which I like, very
> much, and they're much more sophisticated and deal with much more
> complicated questions of post-colonial identity and economic power and so on.
> But I am just fascinated with a box with white walls and a flat roof, how
> that one little thing never ever came close to being sort of in an obvious
> synergy with the descriptions of it. Modern architecture never was what it
> was said to be, in its most basic level. So one was the desire to call into
> question those points of view, not for the historical reasons, but for the
> theoretical reasons. In the end, what fascinates me the most is ornament.
> Basically it's a book about ornament, as was the book on deconstruction.

> Ornament, by definition, is that which does not need to be there. And nothing
> is more pleasurable for me than showing that the thing that does not need to
> be there is the one thing without which nothing could be there. So to say
> that that was true of modern architecture is just the very example, because
> modern architecture appeared to remove that which was unnecessary, in the
> favor of the necessary. So the ornament was an easy victim, oh no, no no!
> There was, in my opinion, not a single architect of the circle of the modern
> movement who believed that they were removing decoration, Le Corbusier being
> probably one of the most intelligent; his slogan that the decorative art of
> today was that art which was not decorative, fully understands the paradox
> that the plain white wall is the decorative art of his day; that removing
> decoration is the decorative posture of his time. So he knew perfectly that
> he was not removing decoration – he was redefining what it should be. Like
> Adolf Loos, arguing that what was the appropriate decoration for his time. So
> the book was more trying to make people thing about decoration than think
> about moderna architecture, ultimately.

> **Q:** … What is the role of theory in deconstructivist architecture?
>
> **A:** Zero. It had zero role. Bernard Tschumi and Peter Eisenman had a
> self-conscious understanding of deconstruction. Libeskind had a kind of
> Babylon babble, not to discredit it. Gehry has a clearly anti-theory theory,
> and so on and so on.
>
> … Theory itself played no role. Well, to put it another way, in no way did
> their specific knowledge of theory (in the case of Tschumi and Eisenman) in
> any way contribute to their projects.
