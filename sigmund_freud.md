## Quotes

> To deny something in one's judgement is the same thing as to say: “That is
> something that I would rather repress”. A negative judgement is the
> intellectual substitute for repression; the “No” in which it is expressed is
> the hallmark of repression, a certificate of origin, as it were, like “Made
> in Germany”.

> <cite>Sigmund Freud</cite>, Negation, in: General Psychological Theory
