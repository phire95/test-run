> It is a testament to Isozaki's independence that, while subject to Metabolist
> influence, he always maintained a certain distance from the fictive
> utopianism of the movement, preferring to comment from the wings, as it were,
> rather than respond too directly to catalytic exhortations of Noboru Kawazoe
> who was Metabolism's main ideologue.
>
> Thus, while being theoretically concerned with the creation of transformable
> mega-structures, Isozaki literally kept his feet on the ground as he
> continued to be involved, after Tokyo Bay, with the more prominent commissions
> of the Tange office. At the same time, doubts were beginning to arise in
> Isozaki's mind as to the maniacal aims of Metabolism, as typified, say, by
> Kisho Kurokawa's Wall City proposal of 1959. Moreover, as far as Isozaki was
> concerned, equally unbalanced forms of megalomania could be detected in the
> work of URTEC itself.
