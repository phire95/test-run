Part of the Critical Subjects summer school series of debates, lectures and panel discussions.

## Notes

### Catherine Rossi

- The only avant-garde that she knows anything about is the radical design groups of the late 60's and early 70's (SUPERSTUDIO, Archizoom, etc)
- Already in 1978, the architects of the radical period were asking themselves "whatever happened to the avant-garde?"
- The answer is, they got old.
- Yes we need change, yes we need to make manifestos.
- Radicalism shows that being the avant-garde is not just tehcnological, but also about engaging your surroundings (eg: hadid is not avant-garde just because her office is a tehnical innovator)
- Whatever avant-garde is ahead of us, it will not be a totalising one like we had in the past century.
