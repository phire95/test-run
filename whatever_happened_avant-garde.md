Part of the Critical Subjects summer school series of debates, lectures and panel discussions.

## Notes

### Catherine Rossi

Catherine is a historian.

- The only avant-garde that she knows anything about is the radical design
  groups of the late 60's and early 70's (SUPERSTUDIO, Archizoom, etc)
- Already in 1978, the architects of the radical period were asking themselves
  "whatever happened to the avant-garde?"
- The answer is, they got old.
- Yes we need change, yes we need to make manifestos.
- Radicalism shows that being the avant-garde is not just technological, but
  also about engaging your surroundings (eg: Hadid is not avant-garde just
  because her office is a technical innovator)
- Whatever avant-garde is ahead of us, it will not be a totalising one like we
  had in the past century.

### Joseph Young

Joseph is an artist, part of the NeoFuturist collective

- Joseph reads a poem from his iPad about the market swallowing the avant-garde
- "for art to be free it must have no ideology"
- "art must be about the sublime"

### Kim Quazi

Kim is the director of ARUP Associates

- The avant-garde can only be recognised historically.
- Before, manifestos were written to bring people together. Now, with the
  internet, everything is watered down.
- Big ideas got co-opted
- Remembers going to the Sensation exhibition and being excited by it. Now,
  looking back, he finds it sad.
- The perfect-ish knowledge that marketers and government have make it very
  easy to assimilate the "trending" ideas.
- Compared to his student days, the students he teacher are:
  - Less political
  - Less angry (negates the need to form an opposition)
  - These days, to be critical you need to be poor, rich or paid by the state.
    Others can't afford to be.
- Thesis: the state should allow and support people to be themselves, we are
  no longer in a world where we can create Dada due to surveillance.

### Michael Delay

Michael runs ArtWatch UK

- The avant-garde is nowhere and everywhere
- The avant-garde has been coerced
- Recalls "when attitudes become form", and Tschimi's participation to him now
  being professor at Columbia and his discussing the fate of the Elgin Marbles
- "avant-gardism, in art and architecture, has always struck me as
  anti-historicist", meaning: naivete and self-interested.
- The central premise of avant-gardism is a paradox, as the future is not
  waiting to be discovered in the present.
- Michael explicates how the arts council works in the UK. How and
  «avant-garde» operates these days and how it has plunged into the hands of
  the art-market:
  - The arts council funds artists
  - Gallerists buy these state funded artists as guaranteed killer profits
- "Many people can't realise that avant-gardism does not have to be left wing.
  People can't get it into their heads that the most radical politician that
  Britain has had was a woman named Margret Thatcher."
- We should question the position that artists should be radical. Art does not
  exist to change the world, but to enrich it.
- We should not go around labelling non «radical» artists as «reactionary». Most
  of the time, the debate is irrelevant.
- Radicalism can be benighted, certainly as much as any reactionary.
