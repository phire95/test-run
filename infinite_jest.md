## Notes

#### How does Pemulis get the DMZ?

Off the Antitoi brothers.

> Hal's arrangement of the tablets on the red-and-gray counterpane is almost Zen
> in its precision. 'These are from the 70s?â€™
>
> After intricate third-party negotiations, Michael Pemulis finally landed 650
> mg. of the vaunted and elusive compound DMZ or 'Madame Psychosis' from a
> small-arms-draped duo of reputed former Canadian insurgents who now undertook
> small and probably kind of pathetic outdated insurgency-projects from behind
> the front-operation of a cut-rate mirror, blown-glass, practical joke 'n gag,
> trendy postcard, and low-demand old film-cartridge emporium called Antitoi
> Entertainment, just up Prospect St. from Inman Square in Cambridge's decayed
> Portugo/Brazilian district. Because Pemulis always conducts business solo and
> speaks no French, the whole transaction with the Nuck in charge had to be
> negotiated in dumbshow, and since this lumberjackish Antitoi Nuckwad tended to
> look from side to side before he communicated even more than Pemulis looked all
> around himself, with his dim-looking partner standing there cradling a broom
> and also scanning for eavesdroppers in the closed shop the whole time, the
> whole negotiated deal had resembled a kind of group psychomotor seizure, with
> different bits of whipping and waggling heads reflected in dislocated sections
> and at jagged angles in more mirrors and pebbled blown-glass vases than Pemulis
> had ever seen crammed into anywhere. A very low-rent TP indeed had a
> hardcore-porn cartridge going at five times the normal speed so it looked like
> crazed rodents and may have turned Pemulis's sexual glands off for all time, he
> feels. God alone knew where these clowns had acquired thirteen incredibly
> potent 50-mg. artifacts of the B.S. 1970s. But the good news is they were
> Canadians, and like fucking Nucksters about almost anything they had no idea
> what what they were in possession of was worth, as it slowly emerged. Pemulis,
> w/ aid of 150 mg. of time-release Tenuate Dospan, almost danced a little
> post-transaction jig on his way up the steps of the otiose Cambridge bus,
> feeling the way W. Penn in his Quaker Oats hat in like the 16th century must
> have felt trading a few trinkets to babe-in-the-woods Natives for New Jersey,
> he imagines, doffing the nautical cap to two nuns in the aisle.

#### ETA players' sponsors

The Port Washington players all wear matching socks and shorts and tucked-in
shirts. They look sharp but effete, a mannequinish aspect to them. Most of the
higher-ranked E.T.A. students are free to sign on with different companies for
no fees but free gear. Coyle is Prince and Reebok, as is Trevor Axford. John
Wayne is Dunlop and Adidas. Schacht is Head Master sticks but his own clothes
and knee-supports. Ortho Stice is Wilson and all-black Fila. Keith Freer is Fox
sticks and both Adidas and Reebok until one of the two companies' NNE reps
catches on. Troeltsch is Spalding and damn lucky to get that. Hal Incandenza is
Dunlop and lightweight Nike hightops and an Air Stirrup brace for the dicky
ankle. Shaw is Kennex sticks and clothes from Tachani's Big St Tall line.
Pemulis's entrepreneurial vim has earned him complete freedom of choice and
expense, though he's barred by deLint and Nwangi from shirts that mention the
Sinn Fein or that extol Allston MA in any way, in competition.
