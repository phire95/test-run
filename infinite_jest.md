## Notes

#### How does Pemulis get the DMZ?

Off the Antitoi brothers.

> Hal's arrangement of the tablets on the red-and-gray counterpane is almost Zen
> in its precision. 'These are from the 70s?’
>
> After intricate third-party negotiations, Michael Pemulis finally landed 650
> mg. of the vaunted and elusive compound DMZ or 'Madame Psychosis' from a
> small-arms-draped duo of reputed former Canadian insurgents who now undertook
> small and probably kind of pathetic outdated insurgency-projects from behind
> the front-operation of a cut-rate mirror, blown-glass, practical joke 'n gag,
> trendy postcard, and low-demand old film-cartridge emporium called Antitoi
> Entertainment, just up Prospect St. from Inman Square in Cambridge's decayed
> Portugo/Brazilian district. Because Pemulis always conducts business solo and
> speaks no French, the whole transaction with the Nuck in charge had to be
> negotiated in dumbshow, and since this lumberjackish Antitoi Nuckwad tended to
> look from side to side before he communicated even more than Pemulis looked all
> around himself, with his dim-looking partner standing there cradling a broom
> and also scanning for eavesdroppers in the closed shop the whole time, the
> whole negotiated deal had resembled a kind of group psychomotor seizure, with
> different bits of whipping and waggling heads reflected in dislocated sections
> and at jagged angles in more mirrors and pebbled blown-glass vases than Pemulis
> had ever seen crammed into anywhere. A very low-rent TP indeed had a
> hardcore-porn cartridge going at five times the normal speed so it looked like
> crazed rodents and may have turned Pemulis's sexual glands off for all time, he
> feels. God alone knew where these clowns had acquired thirteen incredibly
> potent 50-mg. artifacts of the B.S. 1970s. But the good news is they were
> Canadians, and like fucking Nucksters about almost anything they had no idea
> what what they were in possession of was worth, as it slowly emerged. Pemulis,
> w/ aid of 150 mg. of time-release Tenuate Dospan, almost danced a little
> post-transaction jig on his way up the steps of the otiose Cambridge bus,
> feeling the way W. Penn in his Quaker Oats hat in like the 16th century must
> have felt trading a few trinkets to babe-in-the-woods Natives for New Jersey,
> he imagines, doffing the nautical cap to two nuns in the aisle.

#### How do the Antitoi brothers get the DMZ?

From Robert ‘Sixties Bob’ Monroe (Sorkin's doctor and father of Eighties
Bill (the guy who bets on the Yale vs Brown U.)

Compare the descriptions of with whom the Antitoi brothers traded a lava lamp
and apothecary mirror for DMZ and cartridges with Pamela Hoffman-Jeep's
description of Robert Monroe in the two quotes below. There is a perfect match
of Nehru jacket, salmon-colored glasses, and Grateful Dead (the cover on
Grateful Dead's Blues for Allah depicts a skeleton playing a violin).

> Bertraund had actually been credulous enough with a wrinkled long-haired
> person of advanced years in a paisley Nehru jacket also of great age and a
> puzzling cap with a skeleton playing at the violin emblazoned upon it, on the
> front, wearing also the most stupid-appearing small round wire spectacles
> with salmon-colored lenses
>
> …
>
> Bertraund had been starry-eyed enough to agree to barter the person an
> antique blue lava-lamp and a lavender- tinged apothecary's mirror for
> eighteen unexceptional-looking and old lozenges the long-haired old person
> had claimed in a jumble of West-Swiss-accented French were 650 mg. of a trop-
> formidable harmful pharmaceutical no longer available and guaranteed to make
> one's most hair-raising psychedelic experience look like a day on the
> massage-tables of a Basel hot-springs resort, throwing in as well a
> kitchen-can waste bag filled with crusty old mossy boot-and-leg Read-Only
> cartridges, sans any labels, that appeared to have been stored in a person's
> rear yard and then run through a gaseous dryer of clothes


> Dr. Robert ('Sixties Bob') Monroe — the septuagenarian
> pink-sunglasses-and-Nehru-jacket-wearing
> N.C.-F.P.F.ergotic-vascular-headache-treatment specialized, a guy who in
> yore-days interned at Sandoz and was one of T. Leary's original circle of
> mayonnaise-jar acid-droppers at T. Leary's now-legendary house in West Newton
> MA, and is now (60s B.) an intimate acquaintance of Kite, because Sixties Bob
> is an even bigger Grateful Dead fanatic maybe even than Kite, and sometimes got
> together with Kite and several other Dead devotees (most of who now had canes
> and O2 tanks) and traded historical-souvenir-type tiger's eyes and paisley
> doublets and tie-dyes and lava lamps and bandannas and plasma spheres and
> variegated black-light posters of involuted geometric designs, and argued about
> which Dead shows and bootlegs of Dead shows were the greatest of all time in
> different regards, and just basically had a hell of a time. 60s B., an
> inveterate collector and haggling trader of shit, sometimes took Kite along on
> little expeditions of eclectic and seedy shops for Dead-related paraphernalia,
> sometimes even informally fencing stuff for Kite (and so indirectly Gately),
> covering Kite with $ when Kite's rigid need-schedule didn't permit a more
> formal and time-consuming fence, Sixties Bob then trading the merchandise
> around various seedy locales for 60s-related shit nobody else'd even usually
> want.

#### ETA players' sponsors

> The Port Washington players all wear matching socks and shorts and tucked-in
> shirts. They look sharp but effete, a mannequinish aspect to them. Most of the
> higher-ranked E.T.A. students are free to sign on with different companies for
> no fees but free gear. Coyle is Prince and Reebok, as is Trevor Axford. John
> Wayne is Dunlop and Adidas. Schacht is Head Master sticks but his own clothes
> and knee-supports. Ortho Stice is Wilson and all-black Fila. Keith Freer is Fox
> sticks and both Adidas and Reebok until one of the two companies' NNE reps
> catches on. Troeltsch is Spalding and damn lucky to get that. Hal Incandenza is
> Dunlop and lightweight Nike hightops and an Air Stirrup brace for the dicky
> ankle. Shaw is Kennex sticks and clothes from Tachani's Big St Tall line.
> Pemulis's entrepreneurial vim has earned him complete freedom of choice and
> expense, though he's barred by deLint and Nwangi from shirts that mention the
> Sinn Fein or that extol Allston MA in any way, in competition.
