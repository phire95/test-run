## Notes

### Some stuff I found sitting on my hard disk

This is old, years old, and needs to be pruned. Notes about early readings of
Heidegger.


* BEING = MEANING
* from Descartes onwards, philosophers had thought of human beings as relating
  to subjects relating to objects, and therefore the fundamental problems that
  were being asked were:
    * how do we as humans have knowledge about these objects, and therefore
      the fundamental problems were about perception, certainty, epistemology
* Heidegger says that this is not central to the human situation.
* He says we are not separate subjects looking behind a window, looking outside
  at an "objective reality" of which we try to get knowledge.
* He says we _are_ amongst it all. we are in the world
    * note that for Heidegger, the "world" is your 

* Hubert Dreyfus: The tradition was always interested in "knowing that",
  whereas Heidegger was interested in "knowing how". This is because:
    * Heidegger is interested in the subjectivity of subjectivity. not so much
      cogito ergo sum, but more just cogito and an analysis of such. Heidegger
      understands that being = sense making, so the question for him is, how do
      we make sense?

* Door know example: when you come into the classroom, you opened the door. You
  did not consciously think "I will stretch out my hand, I will turn the
  doorknob, I will push open the door". You just did. It's only when something
  does not "feel right" that you start to analyse and think about the situation
  and become a problem solving machine. However, you are not one all the time.
  [note that this is from the Dreyfus talks, which paint Heidegger in an
  existential light]

* A hammer could only be a hammer when there is an entire ecosystem of nails,
  etc etc etc. A hammer is only a hammer when it is a being for hammering,
  defined by society

* Phenomenology:
    * The grounding of philosophy in the self
    * ousting of 19th century systematic thinking
    * is not about things "out there" but about the meaning of things in our
      world of use and practical orientation. The significance of things.
    * it is meaning that changes things "out there" into phenomena that
      meaningfully appear to us.

*Thomas Sheehan:*

* Heidegger said he is phenomenological through and through and through. 
* Heidegger is interested in the structural foundations of conciousness.
* If conciousness  is subjective, Heidegger is interested in the subjectivity
  of subjectivity.
* Getting to the ontological roots of how it is possible for us to be concious
* we are constantly entailed in the meaning-making process
* without being, no meaning:
    * If the human race would all die, would there still be being? No. It is
      intrinsically tied to dasein.

* What is it that you first encounter in the living world? The meaningful.
  That's in your face
