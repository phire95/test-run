## Bridge of Houses

Pamphlet Architecture 07, published in 1987, titled "Bridge of Houses".

One of the briefer pamphlets, contains details of two projects: one for
Melbourne and one for Manhattan. The Manhattan one is what I would call "the
Highline before the Highline".

> The site and structural foundation of the Manhattan Bridge of Houses is the
> existing superstructure of an abandoned elevated rail link in the Chelsea
> area of New York City. This steel structure is utilised in its straight leg
> form West 19th Street to West 29th Street parallel to the Hudson River (see
> Manhattan site plan).
>
> West Chelsea is changing from a warehouse district to a residential area.
> With the decline of shipping activity on the west pier front, the many vacant
> warehouse buildings are now being converted to residential lofts. The bridge
> of houses reflects the new character of the area as a place of habitation.
> Re-use rather than demolition of the existing bridge, would be a permanent
> contribution to the character of this city.
>
> This project offers a variety of housing types for the Chelsea are as well
> as an elevated public promenade connecting with the new Convention Center on
> its north end. Height and width of the houses is determined by the
> structural capacity and width of the existing bridge. The houses have
> different uses including housing for old people, economy studios, luxury
> flats, and student housing. The new houses would be built in an alternating
> pattern with a series of 2000 sq ft courtyards - 50% open space. All new
> houses would be built to align with the existing block front at the street
> walls, reinforcing the street pattern. The ornamental portions of the rail
> bridge which pass over the streets remain open.
