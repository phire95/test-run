snippet: notes and thoughts from a lecture by Stalder and Caruso in Prague 2014

_02.10.2014, Kino SvÄ›tozor, Prague_

A double lecture organised by [KRUH](http://www.kruh.info/) as part of their
ETH themed lecture series. During Laurent Stalder's lecture there were multiple
breaks due to technical errors with getting his images on the screen. A too
full cinema hall, I sat on the floor.

## Notes

### Laurent Stalder - Neither old nor new . The quest for an autonomous architecture

1. Can Swiss architecture be defined or even grouped together? John Ruskin,
   over 100 years ago, thought that it can't. He travelled the country and
   mentioned that there could not be a Swiss charachter to architecture, as
   Switzerland is in between Germany, France and Italy and itself follows these
   linguistic and cultural divisons.
1. G. E. Kidder Smith also commented on this, saying how it was impossible to
   unify due to cantonal decisions.
1. Cultural divisons are also used to justify designs, for example Jurg Conzett
   used the difference between the building culture of two cantons (one German
   and one Italian speaking) for his bridge linking them in Traversina. The
   German side represented by wood, the Italian side represented by stone.
1. Yet, if we look at the 1970 competition for EPFL, to which the sven
   participants were purposefully invited based on their geographic location as
   to reprsent the whole of Switzerland, the designs have similar themes and
   approaches. They all contain themes of industry and almost metabolic growth.
1. (at some point I stopped taking notes due to all the techincal
   interruptions)
1. "In architecture, atmosphere begins where the building ends". Since
   atmospheres is gas that surrounds a body.
1. "To understand architecture through it's atmosphere is mostly to understand
   it's surfaces"
1. Talks about Miroslav Sik and Analogue Architecture at ETH. The influence
   this had on treating architecture as an autonomous object.
1. "Rossi was very useful for the city. There was lots of that he didn't talk
   about, but he was very useful".
1. Jackques Herzog: The architect's role is to simultaneously reflect nature
   but remain autonomous".
1. Slide showign HdM's Prada store in Japan: The autonomous architecture object
   is losing its power precisely due to its autonomy, being eaten by
   commodification".

### Adam Caruso - The Fallacy of Modernism

1. In a stragne way, as the first British Canadian teaching at ETH, he finds
   himself trying to go into the history of the school.
2. Miroslav Suk, and his students, with Analogue Architecture were able to
   combine Rossi and Venturi at the ETH.
3. He builds lots of models with his students. Now they are becoming almost
   orthodox in building models just as Sik's students became orthodox at chalk
   drawings. The models are made of card with a laser cutter and coloured with
   chalk.
4. He looks for references and the past of the discipline, and encouraging his
   students to do the same. It is very popular amongst them, learnign from the
   history of the discipline instead of looking at things like biology and
   programming.
5. With the right tools, every context has qualities, even suburbia. This
   caused an argument with Hans Kollhoff, who was not supportive of Adam's
   students using the Berlin of 1990 as a reference.
6. Adam is researching 20th century modern architects who were not modernists.
   Has already created a book on [Fernand
   Pouillon](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/3856763244/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=3856763244&linkCode=as2&tag=zmlka-21&linkId=CJCM3LJAXKBK6SJ3)
   and [Asnago and
   Vender](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/3856763414/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=3856763414&linkCode=as2&tag=zmlka-21&linkId=GH5W5SGGILMLN35U).
7. When Louis Suillivan said "form follows function", he didn't mean that form
   follows programme, but that one has to unify the two.
8. "Architecture cultivates dumb material".
9. Today, if you want something like stone, you must use pre-cast concrete.
   These days, stone facades are just thin sheets which cause jointing
   problems, whereas in the past stone facades were self supporting.

## Thoughts

There were no substantial questions, presumably because everybody was extremely
tired from all the delays. One thing that did come to mind was that throughout
this entire series of lecutres organised by Kruh, we have heard a lot about ETH
and Swiss architecture (understandably so, as the series is only of ETH
professors). Laurent Stalder himself used Rossi and Sik's presence at ETH as
some kind of force that unified Swiss architecture after the 70's, yet, as
somebody who has lived in Geneva, I can't help but feel the absolute lack of
anything said about the other big Swiss architecture school, EPFL.

My perception, admittedly limited as most of my exposure to ETH has been
through these lectures while I am more familiar with EPFL, is that EPFL really
is quite different. Many of talks in the series have made claims to the nature
and charachter of the Swiss approach to architecture, I'd be curious to hear
what role the differnet approaches of the three big Swiss polytechnics have to
do with it.
