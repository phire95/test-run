*02.10.2014, Kino SvÄ›tozor, Prague*

A double lecture organised by [KRUH](http://www.kruh.info/) as part of their
ETH themed lecture series. During Laurent Stalder's lecture there were multiple breaks due to technical errors with getting his images on the screen. A too full cinema hall, I sat on the floor.

## Notes

### Laurent Stalder - Neither old nor new . The quest for an autonomous architecture

1. Can Swiss architecture be defined or even grouped together? John Ruskin, over 100 years ago, thought that it can't. He travelled the country and mentioned that there could not be a Swiss charachter to architecture, as Switzerland is in between Germany, France and Italy and itself follows these linguistic and cultural divisons.
1. G. E. Kidder Smith also commented on this, saying how it was impossible to unify due to cantonal decisions.
1. Cultural divisons are also used to justify designs, for example Jurg Conzett used the difference between the building culture of two cantons (one German and one Italian speaking) for his bridge linking them in Traversina. The German side represented by wood, the Italian side represented by stone.
1. Yet, if we look at the 1970 competition for EPFL, to which the sven participants were purposefully invited based on their geographic location as to reprsent the whole of Switzerland, the designs have similar themes and approaches. They all contain themes of industry and almost metabolic growth.
1. (at some point I stopped taking notes due to all the techincal interruptions)
1. "In architecture, atmosphere begins where the building ends". Since atmospheres is gas that surrounds a body.
1. "To understand architecture through it's atmosphere is mostly to understand it's surfaces"
1. Talks about Miroslav Sik and Analogue Architecture at ETH. The influence this had on treating architecture as an autonomous object.
1. Quotes Jackques Herzog: The architect's role is to simultaneously reflect nature but remain autonomous".
1. Slide showign HdM's Prada store in Japan: The autonomous architecture object is losing its power precisely due to its autonomy, being eaten by commodification".
