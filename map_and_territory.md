The map and the territory.

A phrase that has somehow, most likely thought that all too human trait of
seeing everything in nothing, come to capture a lot of the things that one
comes across.


## Notes

### Houllebecq

The following passage, from [The Map and the
Territory](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0099554577/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=zmlka-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0099554577)[^notread].

> The following day, [Jed's] father fetched him on his Mercedes. Around eleven
> they got onto the A20, one of the most beautiful motorways in France, one of
> those that cross the most harmonious rural landscapes; the air was clear and
> mild, with a little mist on the horizon. At three they stopped, at a service
> station just before the La Souterraine; at his father's request, while he
> filled the tank, Jed bought a Michelin Departmenets road map of the Creuse
> and Haute-Vienne.
>
> It was then, unfolding the map, while standing by the cellophane-wrapped
> sandwiches, that he had his second great aesthetic revelation. This map was
> sublime. Overcome, he began to tremble in front of the food display. Never
> had he contemplated an object as magnificent, as rich in emotion and meaning,
> as this 1/150,000-scale Michelin map of the Creuse and Haute-Vienne. The
> essence of modernity, of scientific and technical apprehension of the world,
> was here combined with the essence of animal life. The drawing was complex
> and beautiful, absolutely clear, using only a small palette of colours. But
> in each of the hamlets and villages, represented according to their
> importance, you felt the thrill, the appeal,of human lives, of dozens and
> hundreds of souls â€“ some destined for damnation, others for eternal life.

> The entrance to the hall was barred by a big panel, leaving two-meters-wide
> passageways at either side, on which Jed had displayed a satellite photo taken
> around the mountain of Guebwiller next to an enlargement of a Michelin
> Departements map of the same zone. The contrast was striking: while the
> photograph showed only a soup made of more or less uniform green sprinkled
> with vague blue spots, the map developed a fascinating maze of departmental
> and scenic road, *viewpoints*, forests lakes and cols.
>
> Above the two enlargements, in black capital letters, was the title of the
> exhibition: THE MAP IS MORE INTERESTING THAN THE TERRITORY.
