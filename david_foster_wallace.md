## Quotes

> WILEY: In your essay "E Unibus Pluram," you talk about irony in television
> and sometimes in fiction as something toxic.
>
> DFW: See, here's the hard part about talking about something like that -- it
> takes a 60-page essay to develop the question, and so I'm going to be very
> uncomfortable about anything I'll just say discursively off the cuff. Now --
> the point of the essay is that the ironic function like in postmodern fiction
> started out with a rehabilitative agenda. Largely it was supposed to explode
> hypocrisy -- certain hypocritically smug ways the country saw itself that
> just weren't holding true anymore. The problem is that when irony becomes in
> and of itself just a mode of social discourse, that is it's not really about
> causing any sort of change any more, it's just sort of a hip, cool way to do
> it -- to speak and to act, to sort of make fun of everything and yourself and
> being really afraid of being made fun of. A certain amount of this comes out
> of the work of this essayist named Lewis Hyde, who I believe for a while
> lived in Minneapolis. This was an essay about John Berryman -- I think I cite
> it in (A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again). Anyway, Hyde talks about
> irony after a while becoming the sound of prisoners who enjoy their
> confinement. The song of a bird who enjoys being in the cage. For instance,
> if I'm uncomfortable with how commercial the culture is and how everybody
> seems to be out for a buck, I decide so I'll do it too, but I'll kind of make
> fun of myself and say, 'I'm a whore, just like you're a whore,' and now we
> all get an uneasy laugh out of it. But we've somehow taken a situation that
> originally I was unhappy about, and it may perhaps put some pressure on me to
> opt out of, and instead I take the easy decision, but I adopt this patent of
> irony about it that shields me from criticism for it. That may be the
> clearest quick way of talking about it. I think the people like my age and
> younger relate to irony, which is largely unconscious and largely is used as
> a mechanism for avoiding some really thorny issues -- I think that's toxic.
> Irony itself is fantastic. It's one of the primary rhetorical modes. It's
> been around forever. It's intensely powerful.  There's nothing wrong with it.
