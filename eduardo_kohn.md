## Quotes

> My call to provincialise language is to find ways of recognising how human
> language is the product of just one kind of sign system nested within a much
> broader semiotic universe that extends beyond the human. It is because
> representation extends beyond the human and beyond language that we can make
> claims about other than human representational processes.
> <cite>Eduardo Kohn</cite>, [Thinking with a forest's thoughts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSdrdY6vmDo) 

> Our distinct human kind of thinking is not the only kind of thinking
> available to us, and this, for me, is why we need to provincialise language.
> <cite>Eduardo Kohn</cite>, [Thinking with a forest's thoughts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSdrdY6vmDo) 

> in an anthropology beyond the human what we are trying to do is to consider
> the distinct kinds of reals beyond that human that emerge in this forest.
