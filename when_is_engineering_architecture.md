Part of the Critical Subjects summer school series of debates, lectures and
panel discussions.

## Notes

### Steve Webb

1. All architecture is engineering. That fact is inescapable.
1. after we got over the shock factor of what engineering can do (eg: bridges,
   towers) the engineer has become more of a statistics accountant.
1. Recently there has been a communion of architecture and engineering in
   high-tech, even though it quickly turned into ornament.
1. It is a good idea to bring together architecture and engineering, allowing
   us to be more efficient, do things for more people with less money, to bring
   more logic into design.
1. "What irks me about architecture is decoration. Why do we have all this
   stuff? Why can't we make structure beautiful too?"
1. Engineers are, typically, inarticulate and uncreative.

### David Marks

1. Perhaps because there is so much architecture with a small a, and o much
   engineering with a small e, that we should concentrate on the good stuff
   only.

### John Roycroft

1. Architecture and engineering are a mindset. Good architecture is when there
   is a success of all disciplines involved.
