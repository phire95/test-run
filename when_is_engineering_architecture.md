*14.07.2004 - ARUP Associates, London*

Part of the Critical Subjects summer school series of debates, lectures and
panel discussions.

## Notes

### Steve Webb

* All architecture is engineering. That fact is inescapable.
* after we got over the shock factor of what engineering can do (eg: bridges,
  towers) the engineer has become more of a statistics accountant.
* Recently there has been a communion of architecture and engineering in
  high-tech, even though it quickly turned into ornament.
* It is a good idea to bring together architecture and engineering, allowing us
  to be more efficient, do things for more people with less money, to bring
  more logic into design.
* "What irks me about architecture is decoration. Why do we have all this
  stuff? Why can't we make structure beautiful too?"
* Engineers are, typically, inarticulate and uncreative.

### David Marks

* Perhaps because there is so much architecture with a small a, and o much
  engineering with a small e, that we should concentrate on the good stuff only.

### John Roycroft

* Architecture and engineering are a mindset. Good architecture is when there is
  a success of all disciplines involved.
