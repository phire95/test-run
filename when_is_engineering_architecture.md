* Steve Webb
* David Marks
* John Roycroft
* Paul Reeves

## Notes

### Steve Webb

* All architecture is engineering. That fact is unescapable.
* after we got over the shock factor of what engineering can do (eg: bridges, towers) the engineer has become more of a statistics accountant.
* Recently there has been a comunion of architecture and engineering in high-tech, even though it quickly turned into ornament.
* It is a good idea to bring together architectue and engineering, allowing us to be more efficient, do things for more people with less money, to bring more logic into design.
* "What irks me about architecture is decoaration. Why do we have all this stuff? Why can't mwe make structure beautiful too?"
* Engineers are, typically, inarticulate and uncreative.

### David Marks

* Perhaps because there is so much architecture with a small a, and o much engineering with a small e, that we should ocnentrate on the good stuff only.

### John Roycroft

* Architectre and engineering are a mindset. Good architecture is when there is a sucess of all disciplines involved.
