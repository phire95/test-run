_22.10.2014, [Tranzitdisplay](http://www.tranzitdisplay.cz), Prague_

Zbyněk Baladrán: co-curator of TD, artist  
Ondřej Horák: runs educational programmes for TD, does many things outside of it

## Notes

1. A brief history of TD, which is something that can probably be found on the
   website, the important thing is what is written in their
   [manifesto](http://www.tranzitdisplay.cz/en/manifesto). Also worth
   mentioning is that TD is quite clear on what it's aim are and what can be
   seen there. Challenging contemporary art, primarily international (they
   estimate that they show one Czech artist every two years), and somehow a
   concentration on post-colonial themes, in the sense of work reacting to
   radical transformations in society.
2. How does a show get made? Personal contact. Ondřej is still in touch with
   many of the artists they worked with for Manifesta 8, expanding on their
   work and getting more involved with them, which is something that was not
   possible during a large group show. For example, the current exhibtion,
   Loulou Cherinet, is somebody that Ondřej worked with before.
3. TD hardly ever publishes catalogues or texts explaining their exhibitions.
4. Funding. TD has the fortunate position of a very stable income in the form
   of a grant from Erste Foundation. This is very stable because Erste founded
   Tranzit (before they merged with Display), and has been giving them yearly
   grants since. This gives TD huge flexibility compared to other small
   galleries, since TD's funding in annual and not project specific, which is
   the common way of grant distribution. TD is very independent from its
   funders.
5. TD has a stable theme, which differentiates them from "boom" galleries which
   will put on shows to sustain themselves or to follow trends. They have their
   audience.
6. This audience is, admittedly, very small. Let's say 30-50 people will come
   to an exhibition opening, along with about 7 visitors a day gives them an
   audience of 150 people. All of which probably know each other.
7. However, they aim to always have something happening, unlike other galleries
   that are pretty much dead after the verinissage. There is a projection space
   that anybody who asks can use, a research and working space.
8. That's the only way for a gallery to exist in the 21st century. Something
   has to be happening there.
8. Back to the exhibits: with 45 square meters of exhibition space, they can't
   try to substitute work that should be done by public galleries. Some people
   seem to expect them to do this, or even think they do as they cover themes
   that are not covered elsewhere, but this can't be the case. They are a
   gallery that exhibits «difficult» art, and do not think of themselves as
   having a mandate to fill a specific hole left by the state. Likewise, they
   don't claim to be the be-all end-all of post-colonial art or themes. “We are
   laymen that produce shows”.
9. TD is, then, for a specific type of audience. A type of audience that has
   certain knowledge and understanding, if they don't have it they won't come
   because, frankly, they would be wasting their time. This seems to some to be
   elitism. They are aware of it. But that's kind the point, not to be elitist,
   but that they just happen to put on shows that not many people go to. As
   above, they are not trying to be a substitute for the national gallery.
