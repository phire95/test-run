A completely full lecture room.

## Notes


1. It is a bit strange to talk about projects that one already built, because a
   finished house should speak for itself
1. Space is the main thing in architecture. Architecture is a medium.
1. (while showing his design for Tomio Okarmura) To create infinity, to use a
   house as a medium to create endlessness you have two options:
        * Open to the outside 
        * Repeat the inside
1. (describing a building for three families) Everything that does not belong
   in a building is outside: staircase, elevator, shafts.
1. (on context) I come from the periphery around Zurich, and I can assure you
   that there is no context ... I would love to build in the centre of Prague
   where I would have to care about the historical. I often hate the context
   that I work in. An objection to context is contextual.
1. (on sustainability) How much can you really contribute as an architect? I
   think the only answer is to make the energy worth it.
