> I was friends and connected with the Berlage family. So I had the privilege
> of meeting and talking now and then with Berlage. I admired his works, his
> buildings, and his building principles. In the beginning I tried to follow
> the latter, and, later, I strove after enlargement of his principles and came
> to ideas of my own. This did not really lead to conclusions other than the
> ones to which he came. I think that part of his principle was to build
> honestly. Not to build with adornments and so on, but to build exactly out of
> construction. That was what interested me in Berlage very much. It may be
> that I admire more what he did after his convictions than what he showed. I
> don't think what he did is all beautiful. He also made ugly things, but the
> things were true. It was the first time you saw a true architecture. That was
> what interested me so much, you see.
