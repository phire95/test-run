a masterpiece. 

## Quotes

> The old civic, state and national groupings have become unworkable. Nothing
> can be further from the spirit of the new technology than "a place for
> everything and everything in its place". You can't <u>go</u> home again.

> Environments are not passive wrappings, but are, rather, active processes
> which are invisible. The groundrules, pervasive structure, and over-all
> patterns of environments elude easy perception. Anti-environments, or
> counter situations made by artists, provide means of direct attention and
> enable us to see and understand more clearly. The interplay between the old
> and the new environments creates many problems and confusions. The main
> obstacle to clear a clear understanding of the effects of the new media is
> our deeply embedded habit of regarding all phenomena from a fixed point of
> view. We speak, for instance, of "gaining perspective". This psychological
> process derives unconsciously from print technology.

### Quotes by Others

Haven't found the original mention of the "sunset effect", which is used to
describe the shortcomings of one thing being used to power something that came
after it. Not in the positive sense that they are overcome, but in the sense
that they are doubled down on.

> Marshall McLuhan aptly termed a sunset effect, an exaggerated caricature of
> now obsolete characteristics of a waning era. Parametricism and icons
> exacerbate rather than solve the main failings of modern architecture.
