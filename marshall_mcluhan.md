[The Medium is the Massage](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/014103582X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=014103582X&linkCode=as2&tag=zmlka-21) is -on terms of form, content and their marriage-
a masterpiece. 

## Quotes

> The old civic, state and national groupings have become unworkable. Nothing
> can be further from the spirit of the new technology than "a place for
> everything and everything in its place". You can't <u>go</u> home again.

> Environments are not passive wrappings, but are, rather, active processes
> which are invisible. The groundrules, pervasive structure, and over-all
> patterns of environments elude easy perception. Anti-environments, or
> counter situations made by artists, provide means of direct attention and
> enable us to see and understand more clearly. The interplay between the old
> and the new environments creates many problems and confusions. The main
> obstacle to clear a clear understanding of the effects of the new media is
> our deeply embedded habit of regarding all phenomena from a fixed point of
> view. We speak, for instance, of "gaining perspective". This psychological
> process derives unconsciously from print technology.
