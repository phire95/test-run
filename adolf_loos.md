## Quotes

> The house has to please everyone, contrary to the work of art which does not.
> The work is a private matter for the artist. The house is not. The work of
> art is brought into the world without there being a need for it. The house
> satisfies a requirement. The work of art is responsible to none; the house is
> responsible to everyone. The work of art wants to draw people out of their
> state of comfort. The house has to serve comfort. The work if art is
> revolutionary; the house is conservative. The work of art shows people new
> directions and thinks of the future. The house thinks of the present. Man
> loves everything that satisfies his comfort. He hastes everything that wants
> to draw him out of his acquired and secured position and that disturbs him.
> Thus he loves the house and hates art. Does it follow that the house has
> nothing in common with art and is architecture not to be included amongst the
> arts? That is so. Only a very small part of architecture belongs to art: the
> tomb and the monument. Everything else that fulfils a function is to be
> excluded from the domain of art.
