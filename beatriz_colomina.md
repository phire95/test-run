## Quotes

> My reading of the story is that Ariadne is the first architect, not Deadalus
> as it is usually said; because although he built the labyrinth, she is the
> one that was able to decipher it by basically figuring out the order that is
> actually in the labyrinth with the use of a thread. So, despite the apparent
> disorder of the labyrinth there is a way of representing its order, and she
> represents that order. That's why I like this myth of Ariadne, because it
> contradicts the usual expectations of merging disorder with the feminine.
> Here, the feminine is the figure that will get you out of the disorder.
