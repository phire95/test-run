I've been out and about architecture for a while.

I frequently am asked to give book recommendations, and frequently see people
asking for book recommendations on the internet. In this overview, I'll compile
some of my answers.


## Introduction

I used to run an architecture themed reading[^atrap] group while still in
architecture school.

The reading group grew out of a frustration that as students of architecture
whose task it was to design buildings relevant to the present, did not have a
platform to discuss present contemporary architecture. History classes start
with Egypt, meaning that you only cover the 20th century in your last year of
studies There is nothing wrong with the way history is taught, but it means
that, for the majority of students, exposure to contemporary architecture lies
solely in the hands of a few resources of questionable quality (archi-spam
blogs especially).

The reading group, then, had a double mission of reflection on what's going on
now, and at the same time providing the tools necessary to be able to have the
discussion: a knowledge of 20th century architecture. There was [an
introduction](http://atrap.org/about.html), a list of
[principles]http://atrap.org/principles.html) and a
[curriculum](http://atrap.org/curriculum.html).

IF there is one thing to stress from those three pages, it is from the
principles page:

> Primary texts meaning texts that are 0 degrees of separation from the subject
> matter. This means that we concentrate on texts written by architects that
> explain what they were doing, or texts written by theorists which then went
> on the inform what architects were doing. We look at texts that are of the
> time when they were relevant, not recapitulations and interpretations of
> secondary actors on the work of others.

On to the lists then.

## Frequently recommended books

I don't like the idea of a must have list, everyone can chose what to read, but
these are books that I believe are of such high quality, importance or
usefulness that they can only bring merit. These books should be good presents
for any architect.


### S, M, M, XL by OMA (Rem Koolhaas)
Amazon: [UK](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1885254865/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=1885254865&linkCode=as2&tag=zmlka-21&linkId=OJRQYJHV2U3T3EGY) 
and [US](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1885254865/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1885254865&linkCode=as2&tag=wwwzmlkacom-20&linkId=2E4U57GWC6ZAIGH7)


That's a picture of my battered copy of the book. First read before even starting
architecture studies, enjoyed it very much at the time. I flip through it
regularly.

Although S, M, L, XL is a monograph of a single office, what makes it so
appealing and gives it such «replay value» is that Koolhaas is firstly a good
writer and secondly he is so deeply ingrained and well versed in today's
architecture world. It seems that the more you know, the more you can get out
of the book, as the book contains much more than just project documentation.
Full anecdotes, related and unrelated thoughts, creating the tome was a massive
undertaking, as is reading it.

### Design of Cities by Edmund Bacon
Amazon: [UK](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0140042369/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0140042369&linkCode=as2&tag=zmlka-21&linkId=HMB4I5ZOP4CBYUMY) 
and [US](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140042369/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0140042369&linkCode=as2&tag=wwwzmlkacom-20&linkId=LVOMIQ6GEECNYPWU)

The design of cities is exceptionally well structured book on urban design.
Following the travels and learnings of the author, the book is a sequence of
case studies on canonical acts of urbanism. The book stands out for both it’s
clarity of writing, but especially it’s diagrams. Burke’s diagrams typically
use three colors at most,  are hand drawn and show selective information, and
perfectly illustrate the point being made.

This book is a great introduction to urban design, as well as an amazing
reference for diagramming ideas.

### Toward an Architecture by Le Corbusier
Amazon [UK](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0711228094/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0711228094&linkCode=as2&tag=zmlka-21&linkId=C3SU6Q5PJVWUZ5VX) 
and [US](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0892368225/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0892368225&linkCode=as2&tag=wwwzmlkacom-20&linkId=J5DQ3IRDEN6J5IM3)

There are a couple of translations but be sure to get the John Goodman one
linked above.

In the 20th century, no architect has such referential gravity as Le Corbusier.
While he might not be the most talked about at any given moment, it is his
buildings and writings that managed to capture and inspire much of the
development of architectural thinking in the first half of the century.

Much is said about him, yet most have not even read this short manifesto that
serves as an entry point to making sense of European architecture after World
War I.

### Books of interviews and lectures

Architects often present their work in devious ways.

Anybody who has been through any design course of any kind knows the
overwhelming quantity of half-truths and straight up inventions that are said
during project presentations.
